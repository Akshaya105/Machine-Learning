# Machine-Learning
A project focusing on credit card fraud detection using machine learning techniques.
# Abstract
As the number of credit card transactions keep growing and represent an increasing share of the 
European payment system. Leading to several stolen account numbers and subsequent losses to 
banks, also people believed that credit card transaction fraud is a growing threat with severe 
implications for the financial industry. Data mining (Machine Learning) plays a crucial role in 
detecting credit card fraud in both online and offline transactions. Credit card fraud detection 
which is a data mining problem becomes challenging for two main reasons. First, the 
characteristics of normal and fraudulent behavior are continually changing, and second, the credit 
card fraud dataset is highly asymmetric. The performance of fraud detection in credit card 
transactions is greatly affected by the sampling method of the dataset and the choice of variables 
and the detection techniques used. This paper investigates the performance of linear regression 
(LR), logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
Decision Tree (DT), ANN, MLP, Random Forest, XG Booster and Na√Øve Bayes on credit card 
fraud data. The dataset of credit card transactions obtained from Kaggle containing 284,807
transactions. A mixture of under-sampling and oversampling techniques applied to the unbalanced 
data. The five strategies used to the raw and preprocessed data, respectively. This work 
implemented in Python.
